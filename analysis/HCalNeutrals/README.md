# HCal Neutral Analysis Files
The ineff.py script plots the inefficiency as a function of radiation length in the HCal.

```bash
python ineff.py -l <label> <outfile base name> <input file 1> <input file 2> <input file 3>
```

TODO: Cleanup the ineff.py script because it is messy and not very flexible.
