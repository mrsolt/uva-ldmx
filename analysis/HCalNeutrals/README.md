# Configuration Files
Both ldmx-sw and ldmx-analysis are run by using python configuration files. To run a config file use the ```ldmx``` command to operate inside the container and the ```fire``` command. For example, 

```bash
ldmx fire <config file> <options>
```

Details of config files can be found on the [LDMX wiki](https://ldmx-software.github.io).
